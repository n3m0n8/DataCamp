## Planning Data Systems

### Proposed Metrics

The following metrics can be used to track the course's success:
<br />

* Retention: Completion rate of the tasks for each lesson in each chapter. If possible, tracking time spent/attention heat mapping on each lesson/task. Possibly tracking whether provided internal/external links are clicked to show engagement with course content.
<br /> 
* Formative: Transactional data based on the amount of help the learner requests. Summary data from improvement of learner over the three chapters: Do their completion of tasks improve as they progress through the course? 
<br />
* Summative: What grades and final grade do the learners gain? How does their achievement compare with other courses both generally and specifically with respect to their own DataCamp ecosystem experience?
