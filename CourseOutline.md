## Planning Data Systems

### Course Description

### This course is intended for all beginner or intermediate learners who need an introduction to how planning data systems is implemented. 

Its intent is to complement the learner's existing/ongoing knowledge of programming syntax in database or other languages, so as to allow them to deal with the architectural aspect of planning a data system. This is fundamental to avoid mistakes and produce an efficient system. 

The course delivery is done using a free signup to LucidCharts allowing browser-based diagramming.
